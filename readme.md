## MCPU - Minimal CPU for a 32 Macrocell CPLD ##

MCPU is a minimal cpu aimed to fit into a 32 Macrocell CPLD - one of the smallest available programmable logic devices.
While this CPU is not powerful enough for real world applications it has proven itself as a valuable educational 
tool. The source code is just a single page and easily understood. Both VHDL and Verilog versions are supplied.
The package comes with assembler, emulator and extensive documentation. 

This is an old project from 2001. Since it still seems to be of interest to many, I migrated it to Github 
for easier maintenance. Please refer to the [original project description](https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU/blob/master/mcpu.pdf?raw=true) (pdf) for further information.

### Addendum ###

A very nice write up on this design can be found on the blog of Jean-Claude Wippler [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130083617/https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc-a-minimal-computer/). (Archived and shutdown in 2024)

ASM/
	- example programs.
	- simulator.
	- include file for smal.

VHDL/
	- VHDL source of CPU.
	- VHDL testbench.
	- Memory files.
	- The testbench requires a simple sram implementation.

 	  From the Hamburg VHDL archive (http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vhdl/)

verilog/
	- Verilog conversion of CPU source 
	- A small Verilog testbench

SMAL-source/
	- SMAL sourcode.

SIM-source/
   - WIN32 Simulator sourcecode. Porting to other platforms should be easy.
